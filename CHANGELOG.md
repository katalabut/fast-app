## Release Notes

### v0.2.0 - Health Checks Release

This release introduces a comprehensive health check system that makes FastApp truly production-ready. The health check system provides:

- **Kubernetes Integration**: Standard `/health/live` and `/health/ready` endpoints
- **Automatic Discovery**: Services can provide their own health checks
- **Flexible Strategies**: Multiple ways to aggregate health check results
- **Built-in Checks**: Common health checks for HTTP endpoints and databases
- **Performance**: Caching and timeout management for efficient health monitoring

**Breaking Changes:**
- Package `app` renamed to `fastapp`
- Package `config` renamed to `configloader`
- Import paths need to be updated

**Migration Guide:**
```go
// Old
import "github.com/katalabut/fast-app/app"
import "github.com/katalabut/fast-app/config"

// New
import fastapp "github.com/katalabut/fast-app"
import "github.com/katalabut/fast-app/configloader"
```

### v0.1.0 - Initial Release

The first stable release of FastApp provides a solid foundation for building Go applications with:

- Simple service management
- Configuration handling
- Graceful shutdown
- Basic observability

This release establishes the core patterns and interfaces that will be extended in future versions.

## Upgrade Guides

### Upgrading from v0.1.x to v0.2.x

1. **Update import paths:**
   ```bash
   # Use your preferred method to update imports
   find . -name "*.go" -exec sed -i 's|github.com/katalabut/fast-app/app|github.com/katalabut/fast-app|g' {} \;
   find . -name "*.go" -exec sed -i 's|github.com/katalabut/fast-app/config|github.com/katalabut/fast-app/configloader|g' {} \;
   ```

2. **Update package references:**
   ```go
   // Old
   app.New(cfg)
   config.New[Config]()
   
   // New
   fastapp.New(cfg)
   configloader.New[Config]()
   ```

3. **Add health checks (optional but recommended):**
   ```go
   // Add to your services
   func (s *MyService) HealthChecks() []health.HealthChecker {
       return []health.HealthChecker{
           health.NewCustomCheck("my-service", s.checkHealth),
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Update configuration (optional):**
   ```go
   type Config struct {
       App    fastapp.Config
       Health fastapp.HealthConfig  // Add health configuration
       // ... your other config
   }
   ```
