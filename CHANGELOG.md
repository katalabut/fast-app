## [0.2.0] - 2024-01-XX

### 🚀 Major Changes
- **Unified Observability Server**: Consolidated debug and health servers into a single observability service
- **Centralized Configuration**: Moved all configuration structures to `/config` package
- **Single Port Architecture**: All observability endpoints now available on one port (9090 by default)

### ✨ Added
- **New `/config` Package**: Centralized configuration structures for better organization
- **ObservabilityService**: Unified service providing metrics, health checks, and debug endpoints
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Added comprehensive Go doc comments for all exported types and functions
- **Migration Guide**: Detailed guide for upgrading from v0.1.x to v0.2.x
- **Configuration Examples**: YAML configuration examples in `/example` directory

### 🔄 Changed
- **Endpoint Consolidation**:
  - Health endpoints moved from `:8080/health/*` to `:9090/health/*`
  - Metrics endpoint remains at `:9090/metrics`
  - Debug endpoints remain at `:9090/debug/pprof/*`
  - **Port 8080 is now free for your main application**
- **Configuration Structure**:
  - `fastapp.Config` → `config.App` (with backward compatibility alias)
  - `service.DebugServer` configuration no longer needed
  - All observability settings centralized in `config.Observability`

### 🗑️ Removed
- `service.DebugServer` configuration (replaced by unified observability config)
- `service.NewDefaultDebugService()` (observability service is now built-in)
- Separate debug server (consolidated into observability service)

### 💥 Breaking Changes

## Release Notes

### v0.2.0 - Health Checks Release

This release introduces a comprehensive health check system that makes FastApp truly production-ready. The health check system provides:

- **Kubernetes Integration**: Standard `/health/live` and `/health/ready` endpoints
- **Automatic Discovery**: Services can provide their own health checks
- **Flexible Strategies**: Multiple ways to aggregate health check results
- **Built-in Checks**: Common health checks for HTTP endpoints and databases
- **Performance**: Caching and timeout management for efficient health monitoring

**Breaking Changes:**
- Package `app` renamed to `fastapp`
- Package `config` renamed to `configloader`
- Import paths need to be updated

**Migration Guide:**
```go
// Old
import "github.com/katalabut/fast-app/app"
import "github.com/katalabut/fast-app/config"

// New
import fastapp "github.com/katalabut/fast-app"
import "github.com/katalabut/fast-app/configloader"
```

### v0.1.0 - Initial Release

The first stable release of FastApp provides a solid foundation for building Go applications with:

- Simple service management
- Configuration handling
- Graceful shutdown
- Basic observability

This release establishes the core patterns and interfaces that will be extended in future versions.

## Upgrade Guides

### Upgrading from v0.1.x to v0.2.x

1. **Update import paths:**
   ```bash
   # Use your preferred method to update imports
   find . -name "*.go" -exec sed -i 's|github.com/katalabut/fast-app/app|github.com/katalabut/fast-app|g' {} \;
   find . -name "*.go" -exec sed -i 's|github.com/katalabut/fast-app/config|github.com/katalabut/fast-app/configloader|g' {} \;
   ```

2. **Update package references:**
   ```go
   // Old
   app.New(cfg)
   config.New[Config]()
   
   // New
   fastapp.New(cfg)
   configloader.New[Config]()
   ```

3. **Add health checks (optional but recommended):**
   ```go
   // Add to your services
   func (s *MyService) HealthChecks() []health.HealthChecker {
       return []health.HealthChecker{
           health.NewCustomCheck("my-service", s.checkHealth),
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Update configuration (optional):**
   ```go
   type Config struct {
       App    fastapp.Config
       Health fastapp.HealthConfig  // Add health configuration
       // ... your other config
   }
   ```
