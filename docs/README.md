## Examples

### Basic Application
```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    fastapp "github.com/katalabut/fast-app"
    "github.com/katalabut/fast-app/configloader"
)

type MyService struct{}

func (s *MyService) Run(ctx context.Context) error {
    <-ctx.Done()
    return nil
}

func (s *MyService) Shutdown(ctx context.Context) error {
    return nil
}

func main() {
    cfg, _ := configloader.New[fastapp.Config]()
    fastapp.New(cfg).Add(&MyService{}).Start()
}
```

### With Health Checks
```go
func (s *MyService) HealthChecks() []health.HealthChecker {
    return []health.HealthChecker{
        health.NewCustomCheck("my-service", func(ctx context.Context) health.HealthResult {
            return health.NewHealthyResult("Service is healthy")
        }),
    }
}
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General

**Q: What makes FastApp different from other Go frameworks?**
A: FastApp focuses on production-ready applications with minimal boilerplate. It provides essential features like health checks, graceful shutdown, and observability out of the box.

**Q: Is FastApp suitable for microservices?**
A: Yes! FastApp is designed with microservices in mind, providing health checks, service discovery, and container-friendly features.

**Q: Can I use FastApp with existing Go applications?**
A: Absolutely! FastApp is designed to be incrementally adoptable. You can start by wrapping existing services.

### Technical

**Q: How do I add custom health checks?**
A: Implement the `HealthProvider` interface in your service or add global checks using `WithHealthChecks()`.

**Q: Can I customize the health check endpoints?**
A: Yes! Configure the paths and ports in the `HealthConfig` section of your configuration.

**Q: How do I handle database connections?**
A: Use the built-in database health checks and pass your database connection to services through dependency injection.

**Q: Is there support for graceful shutdown?**
A: Yes! FastApp handles graceful shutdown automatically with configurable timeouts.

### Deployment

**Q: How do I deploy FastApp to Kubernetes?**
A: FastApp provides standard health check endpoints that work with Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes. See the [Deployment Guide](./deployment.md).

**Q: Can I run multiple services in one application?**
A: Yes! Add multiple services using `app.Add()`. Each service runs in its own goroutine.

**Q: How do I configure different environments?**
A: Use environment variables to override configuration values. FastApp automatically binds struct fields to environment variables.
